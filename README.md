# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as the capstone assignment for the 4-day Machine Learning Training organized by the Data Science Community at YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The aim of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical data. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and other medically relevant attributes.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest Classifier
Both models were trained and evaluated on the dataset. Hyperparameter tuning for KNN was performed using GridSearchCV, and performance was measured using:

Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix
Feature Importance (Random Forest)

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

Bar charts to compare model accuracy
Feature importance plot for Random Forest
Confusion matrix heatmaps

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
scikit-learn
Google Colab
